<h1>Ninjas throughout CS:GO</h1>
<p><font size="4">The Ninjas formed their CS:GO lineup back in September of 2012. They recruited Patrik "f0rest" Lindberg and Christopher "GeT_RiGhT" Alesund from SK Gaming, Richard "Xizt" Landstr√∂m from Fnatic, who were all CS 1.6 players, and Adam "friberg" Friberg alongside Robin "Fifflaren" Johansson from Counter-Strike: Source. This lineup went on to dominate the scene for the next couple of years, with GeT_RiGhT and f0rest topping every single leaderboard out there. The team was on a 87 - 0 winning streak on LAN, when finally the Russian side of Virtus.pro managed to win a map against them. After that, NiP still went on to dominate, but other contender in the likes of VP from Russia and VeryGames from France came to surface aswell. Ofcourse we can't not mention their own countrymen, Fnatic, who also had their era later on. After all this success, the team finally started losing, and since their support player Fifflaren was getting the most hate, he felt like it was his time to retire. After that the team went through numerous 5th's, yet they still couldn't manage to recreate their early success. After that in their final despair they changed the next two player of the magical 5-man core, Xizt and friberg, instead of them they brought in young blood in the names of Fredrik "REZ" Sterner and William "draken" Sundin, latter of whom was also kicked for being incompatible with the lineup. The latest lineup however seems to have found more success and might even stay together now.
